This code extracts conceptual mappings representing analogies from semantic graphs using the idea stated on the paper:
Herv√°s, Raquel, et al. "Enrichment of automatically generated texts using metaphor." Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2007.

You can do the following with jMapper:

	1 - Run it by simply executing jMapper.
	    Load two ontologies (e.g. King Arthur and Startwars) and see the Metaphors.

	2 - Use the library jMapper in your code. Check the example.
	    Note that you have to add to your project the jMapper.jar and the jar inside lib folder.
