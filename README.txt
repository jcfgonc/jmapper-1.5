You can do the following with jMapper:

	1 - Run it by simply executing jMapper.
	    Load two ontologies (e.g. King Arthur and Startwars) and see the Metaphors.

	2 - Use the library jMapper in your code. Check the example.
	    Note that you have to add to your project the jMapper.jar and the jar inside lib folder.
