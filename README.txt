This code extracts conceptual mappings representing analogies from semantic graphs using an idea based on the Sapper paper:
Veale, Tony, and Mark T. Keane. "The competence of sub-optimal theories of structure mapping on hard analogies." IJCAI (1). 1997.

You can do the following with jMapper:

	1 - Run it by simply executing jMapper.
	    Load two ontologies (e.g. King Arthur and Startwars) and see the Metaphors.

	2 - Use the library jMapper in your code. Check the example.
	    Note that you have to add to your project the jMapper.jar and the jar inside lib folder.

For more details on the algorithm and purpose please read the paper:
